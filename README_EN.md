# Hi, I'm Hayal 👋

**Head of Marketing & Communications | Zurich City School Department**  
**Member of Executive Management | AI Task Force, City of Zurich Administration**

I build open-source tools for AI that serves the public interest — not the other way around. My work connects critical theory, edge AI, and pragmatic process optimization to help public administration and education digitalize on their own terms.

> *"No algorithmic system is neutral. No bureaucratic process is without alternatives. And no data sovereignty happens by itself."*

## What I believe

AI in public administration doesn't fail because of technology — it fails because of missing reflection, blind processes, and the illusion that cloud dependency is inevitable.

Three principles guide my work:

**Think critically before you implement.** If you don't understand the bias and power structures embedded in AI systems, you're automating inequality. Critical theory isn't academic luxury — it's a prerequisite for responsible technology decisions.

**Fix the process first, then add technology.** The biggest risk is putting new software on a broken process. Question first, eliminate second, digitalize — maybe — third.

**Data sovereignty is non-negotiable.** Public institutions that hand their data to proprietary platforms hand over agency. Edge AI, local processing, and open source aren't technical preferences — they're democratic necessities.

## What I build

### 🔍 Claude AI Skills

Specialized instruction sets that turn Claude into a domain expert for specific tasks — calibrated for Swiss public administration and education.

| Skill | What it does |
|:------|:-------------|
| **[Critical AI Literacy](https://github.com/malkreide/critical-ai-literacy-skill)** | Analyze AI systems for bias, power structures, and societal impact — Frankfurt School meets technology critique |
| **[Critical Pedagogy](https://github.com/malkreide/critical-pedagogy-skill)** | Examine curricula, school communications, and educational texts for hidden power dynamics and exclusion mechanisms |
| **[Musk Algorithm](https://github.com/malkreide/musk-algorithm-skill)** | 5-step process analysis (Question → Delete → Simplify → Accelerate → Automate), adapted for public administration |
| **[Socratic Method](https://github.com/malkreide/socratic-method-skill)** | Claude as a Socratic tutor — guided knowledge discovery through systematic questioning instead of direct instruction |

### 🤖 Edge AI & Raspberry Pi

Local AI processing on Raspberry Pi — because sovereign institutions don't send their data to someone else's cloud.

| Project | What it does |
|:--------|:-------------|
| **[Raspberry Pi AI Skill](https://github.com/malkreide/raspberry-pi-ai-skill)** | Claude skill for Raspberry Pi development with edge AI (Hailo-8L NPU), hardware integration, and systematic debugging |
| *More projects in development* | Edge AI prototypes for education and public administration — speech processing, image recognition, and sensor data, all processed locally |

My focus: **AI that runs on a $100 device in a classroom or office** — no cloud dependency, no data leakage, no vendor lock-in.

### 🔧 Personal Workflows

Tools I use daily and share as open source.

| Project | What it does |
|:--------|:-------------|
| **[Notion AI Papers](https://github.com/malkreide/notion-ai-papers)** | Systematic analysis of AI research papers with automated Notion integration — my personal knowledge management system for strategic decision-making |

## Why open source?

Public administration funded by public money should produce public tools. Every skill and project here is MIT-licensed — free to use, free to adapt.

If a city administration in Berlin, Vienna, or Amsterdam faces the same challenges we face in Zurich, they shouldn't have to start from scratch.

## Theoretical foundations

My work rests on four pillars:

- **Critical Theory** (Horkheimer, Adorno, Habermas, Honneth) — Ideology critique and power analysis as the basis for technology decisions
- **Critical Pedagogy** (Freire, Giroux) — Education as liberation practice, not an optimization problem
- **Critical Data Studies** (Buolamwini, Noble, Couldry) — Algorithmic justice and the political economy of data
- **Lean / First Principles** (Musk, Goldratt, Toyota) — Radically pragmatic process optimization that starts with questioning

## Context

The [Zurich City School Department](https://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/ssd/de/index/volksschule/schulamt.html) supports schools and district school boards in managing and developing Zurich's public school system — approximately 32,000 students, 4,500 teachers, 125 schools.

As a member of the **AI Task Force of the City of Zurich Administration**, I work on strategic AI implementation across the entire city government.
